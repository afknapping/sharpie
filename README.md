WIP!

This has originally been a fork of the [Sauce Middleman template](https://github.com/nikiliu/sauce).

It is meant to be used for Prototyping.

Besides enabling Angular as the basic Framework it brings [FontAwesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) as icon repository. I might add Bootstrap soon. Or not.

After cloning do:

    $ bundle
    $ foreman start
    $ open http://localhost:4567/
